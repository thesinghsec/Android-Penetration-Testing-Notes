# 1. What is ADB?

ADB (Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line tool that allows you to interact with an Android device or emulator. It provides access to a Unix shell and enables various debugging and development tasks.

# 2. How ADB Works

* The ADB client checks if an ADB server is running.
* The ADB server binds to TCP port 5037 and listens for commands.
* The ADB daemon (adbd) on the device executes the commands sent by the client.

# 3. Common ADB Commands

## 3.1 Connect to a Device

```
adb connect <IP>
```

Connects to a device using its IP address.

## 3.2 List Connected Devices

```
adb devices
```

Lists all devices connected to the ADB server.

## 3.3 Start/Stop ADB Server

```
adb start-server
adb kill-server
```

Starts or stops the ADB server.

## 3.4 Open a Shell

```
adb shell
```

Opens a Unix shell on the connected device.

## 3.5 Display System Information

```
uname -a
```

Example output:

```
Linux localhost 4.4.34-genymotion #1 SMP PREEMPT Mon Dec 5 15:49:16 UTC 2016 i686
```

* Linux: Operating system.
* localhost: Hostname.
* 4.4.34-genymotion: Kernel version.
* i686: CPU architecture (32-bit x86).

## 3.6 Get ABI Information

```
getprop | grep abi
```

Example output:

```
[ro.product.cpu.abi]: [x86]
[ro.product.cpu.abi2]: [armeabi-v7a]
[ro.product.cpu.abiList]: [x86,armeabi-v7a,armeabi]
[ro.product.cpu.abiList32]: [x86,armeabi-v7a,armeabi]
[ro.product.cpu.abiList64]: []
```

* `ro.product.cpu.abi`: Primary ABI (x86).
* `ro.product.cpu.abi2`: Secondary ABI.
* `ro.product.cpu.abiList`: All supported ABIs.
* `ro.product.cpu.abiList32`: Supported 32-bit ABIs.
* `ro.product.cpu.abiList64`: Supported 64-bit ABIs.

## 3.7 Install an APK

```
adb install <filename.apk>
```

Example:

```
adb install myapp.apk
```

## 3.8 Run ADB as Root

```
adb root
```

Restarts the ADB daemon with root privileges.

## 3.9 Unroot ADB

```
adb unroot
```

Restarts the ADB daemon without root privileges.

## 3.10 Monitor Device Logs

```
adb logcat
```

Displays real-time logs. Useful for debugging and analyzing app behavior.
Use `pidcat` for colorized log analysis.

## 3.11 Copy File to Device

```
adb push <filename> <path>
```

Example:

```
adb push myfile.txt /sdcard/
```

## 3.12 Copy File from Device

```
adb pull <path/filename> <host_path/filename>
```

Example:

```
adb pull /sdcard/myfile.txt ~/Downloads/
```

## 3.13 List Installed Packages

```
adb shell pm list packages
```

Or:

```
cd data/data
ls
```

Lists all installed apps.

## 3.14 List System Apps

```
adb shell pm list packages -s
```

Lists all system apps.

## 3.15 Clear App Data

```
adb shell pm clear <package name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell pm clear com.example.myapp
```

# 4. Dumpsys Commands

```
adb shell dumpsys activity services <package name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell dumpsys activity services com.example.myapp
```

## 4.2 Package Information

```
adb shell dumpsys package <package name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell dumpsys package com.example.myapp
```

## 4.3 Activity Information

```
adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep mResumedActivity
adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep <package name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell dumpsys activity activities | grep com.example.myapp
```

## 4.4 Battery Status

```
adb shell dumpsys battery
```

# 5. Activity Manager (AM) Commands

## 5.1 Start an Activity

```
adb shell am start -n <package name>/<.activity-name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell am start -n com.example.myapp/.MainActivity
```

## 5.2 Stop a Service

```
adb shell am stopservice -n <package name>/<.service-name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell am stopservice -n com.example.myapp/.MyService
```

## 5.3 Start a Service

```
adb shell am startservice -n <package name>/<.service-name>
```

Example:

```
adb shell am startservice -n com.example.myapp/.MyService
```

# 6. Miscellaneous Commands

## 6.1 View Kernel Logs

```
adb shell dmesg
```

Displays kernel logs for debugging low-level issues.

## 6.2 Get Device Model

1234567890abcdef
```

# 7. Why is This Important for Pentesting?

These commands help pentesters:

* Analyze app components (activities, services).
* Debug system and app behavior.
* Gather device information for targeted attacks.
