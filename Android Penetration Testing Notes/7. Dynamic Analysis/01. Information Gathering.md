# 1. What is Dynamic Analysis?

Dynamic Analysis involves analyzing an app while it is running to gather information about its behavior, resources, and interactions. It helps identify runtime issues such as memory leaks, network activity, and loaded libraries.

# 2. Practical

## 2.1 Connect Device and Install Application

```
adb connect 192.168.209.101
adb install ecardsandkeys.apk
```

## 2.2 Get Process ID (PID)

Use `pidof` to get the PID of a running app.

```
adb shell pidof -s com.ecardsandkeys
```

This returns the PID of the app with the package name `com.ecardsandkeys`.

## 2.3 List Open Files for the Process

```
lsof -p 3593
```

**Relevant Fields:**

* NAME: Name of the file or resource.
* TYPE: Type of the resource (e.g., file, socket).

  * DIR: Directory.
  * REG: Regular file.

Useful for spotting unusual files in use.

## 2.4 Check Open Connections

Check open network connections using `/proc/<pid>/net` or `netstat`.

```
cat /proc/<pid>/net/tcp
cat /proc/3593/net/tcp
```

**Relevant Fields:**

* rem\_address: Remote address (IP and port).
* tx\_queue / rx\_queue: Transmit and receive queues.
* uid: User ID of the process.

The output is in hexadecimal.

**Alternative:**

```
netstat -tuln
netstat -p | grep <process-ID>
netstat -p | grep 3593
```

**Relevant Fields:**

* Foreign Address: Remote IP and port.
* Recv-Q / Send-Q: Receive and send queues.
* State: Connection state (ESTABLISHED, LISTEN).

This provides IPs in readable format.

## 2.5 Loaded Native Libraries

Check loaded native libraries:

```
cat /proc/<pid>/maps
cat /proc/3593/maps
```

Shows memory mappings, including loaded libraries and addresses. Check `.so` libraries for possible exploits or malicious files.

# 3. Why is This Important for Pentesting?

Dynamic analysis helps identify runtime vulnerabilities such as:

* Unintended network connections.
* Sensitive data present in memory.
* Malicious or vulnerable native libraries.
