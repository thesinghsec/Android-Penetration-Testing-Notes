## 1. Overview

Introduced in Android 5 (API 21), **Media Projection APIs** allow apps to:

* Capture device screen contents as a media stream.
* Record, playback, or cast to other devices (e.g., TVs).

## 2. Practical

- Open the application and navigate to **All Cards** section. Leave the application open in emulator.

## 4. Pull Screenshot

- Navigate to the file manager on the emulator device or pull the screenshot to Kali using:

```
adb pull /sdcard/card.png
```

- From the screenshot it is clear that it is possible to take a screenshot of sensitive data from the application â€” which is a security concern.
