# 1. Most of the apps use HTTP/HTTPS communications

1. Redirect App's traffic to a proxy tool such as BurpSuite.
2. If HTTPS is used, Burp's root CA needs to be installed on the device.
3. In some cases, we will have to deal with SSL Pinning.
4. If an app targets SDK higher or equal to 24, only the system certificates are trusted.
5. In `build.gradle` file `targetSdkVersion 24` means user installed certificates are ignored and we cannot intercept SSL traffic of an app by default.
6. Three ways to bypass this:
   * Patch the application to trust user installed certificates.
   * Place user certificates in system certificate container.
   * Manipulate the app's runtime.

# 2. Intercept HTTP Traffic

1. Open Burp-Suite and export CA Certificate.

2. Push certificate to Android Emulator:

   ```
   adb push burp.crt /mnt/sdcard/
   ```

3. Navigate to Settings > WIFI > Advanced > Install Certificates.

4. Browse the certificate and install it following the instructions.

5. Open Burp-Suite and open proxy settings.

6. Set Bind address to an interface you want (for example 192.168.22.129 or select all interfaces).

7. On Android Emulator, go to Settings > WiFi. Long press on WiFi network and click Modify Network.

9. Fill Proxy Hostname as 192.168.22.129 and Port as 8080 then click Save.

10. Open the app, enter login details, click Sign In.

11. Traffic will go through Burp-Suite.

12. This allows analysis of HTTP traffic through Burp-Suite.

# 3. Intercept HTTPS Traffic (SSL Pinning with Network Security Configuration)

1. If no traffic appears in Burp-Suite due to SSL Pinning, force the app to trust user certificates.

2. Decompile the APK, change the code, recompile the APK.

3. In `AndroidManifest.xml` check that Network Security is under `xml/network_security_config`.

4. Open the file and add the line:

   ```
   <certificates src="user" />
   ```

5. Recompile the application and push it to the Android Emulator.

6. After installation, the applicationâ€™s traffic will go through Burp-Suite.

7. If there are no entries in the configuration, add them manually to force the app to trust user certificates.
