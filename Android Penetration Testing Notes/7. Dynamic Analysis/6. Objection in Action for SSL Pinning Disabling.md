# 1. What is Objection?

Objection is a runtime mobile exploration toolkit built on top of Frida. It allows you to interact with and manipulate Android/iOS apps without modifying the original APK/IPA.

# 2. Key Features

| Feature                  | Description                                               | Example Command                                                       |
| ------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Frida Gadget Patching    | Embeds Frida into the app for runtime manipulation.       | `objection patchapk -s app.apk`                                       |
| Filesystem Interaction   | Browse, upload, or download files from the app's sandbox. | `objection explore -s "ls /data/data/com.app"`                        |
| Memory Inspection        | List loaded libraries and exported functions.             | `memory list modules`                                                 |
| Root/Jailbreak Bypass    | Simulate or bypass root/jailbreak detection.              | `android root disable`                                                |
| Class & Method Discovery | List loaded classes and their methods.                    | `android hooking list classes`                                        |
| SSL Pinning Bypass       | Disable certificate pinning with one command.             | `android sslpinning disable`                                          |
| Method Argument Dumping  | Log arguments of methods in real-time.                    | `android hooking watch class_method com.app.Class.method`             |
| SQLite Database Access   | Query databases directly from the CLI.                    | `sqlite connect /data/data/com.app/db.db`                             |
| Custom Frida Scripts     | Execute custom Frida scripts.                             | `import script.js`                                                    |
| Component Listing        | List Activities, Services, and Broadcast Receivers.       | `android hooking list activities`                                     |
| Activity Launching       | Start any Activity in the app.                            | `android intent launch_activity com.app.MainActivity`                 |
| Method Tracing           | Monitor method execution in real-time.                    | `android hooking watch class_method com.app.Class.method --dump-args` |

# 3. Pre-Reqs

1. Objection should be installed.
2. Burp Cert should be installed and configured for proxying the traffic.
3. Frida-Server should be up and running in emulator or mobile device.

# 4. Getting Started

1. Install Objection:

   ```
   pip install objection
   ```

2. Get process ID/package of application:

   ```
   frida-ps -Ua
   ```

3. Explore the app (this will restart the application in emulator):

   ```
   objection -g com.ecardsandkeys explore
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a6af3c9-b09a-401b-ac9d-43386c43cfe9)


4. Get path directories:

   ```
   env
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0cd4320f-8314-4ff4-863f-4e2b3d3a5274)


5. Find user ID of the particular application:

   ```
   android shell_exec whoami
   ```
   ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5c168ab7-50fc-4f94-9168-460c96c4a75e)


6. List all the activities:

   ```
   android hooking list activities
   android hooking list services
   android hooking list recievers
   ```

7. To bypass SSL Pinning:

   ```
   android sslpinning disable
   ```

# 5. Why is This Important for Pentesting?

* Dynamic Analysis: Test app behaviour at runtime without reverse engineering.
* Quick Exploitation: Bypass security controls (e.g., SSL pinning, root detection) with minimal effort.
* Real-Time Interaction: Manipulate app logic or data on the fly.
