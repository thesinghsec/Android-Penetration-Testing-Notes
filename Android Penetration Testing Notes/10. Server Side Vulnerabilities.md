### 1. Server-Side Vulnerabilities Overview

* Server-side vulnerabilities often have high impact and are more valuable.
* Most apps interact with **REST APIs** — standard API-specific vulnerabilities apply here too:
  * SQL Injection
  * External XML Entity Injection (XXE)
  * Lack of rate limiting
  * Hidden APIs
  * Sensitive data in responses

### 2. Proxy Setup

* Ensure that the proxy is properly configured in the emulator.
* Open the app, attempt to sign in, and verify that traffic routes through **Burp Suite**.

### 3. Observation

* The app includes a token within a **GET** request — this is a security risk and not best practice.

### 4. Test with Burp Suite

* Send the intercepted request to the **Repeater** and check the response.

### 5. Vulnerability: Sensitive Data in Response

* The app appears to send the password in the response.
* On inspecting the response, only username and email ID are shown.
* This is a vulnerability because:
  * The API retrieves all data from the database table, even if the client requests only specific fields.
  * If the response includes a cleartext password, it means the backend stores passwords in plaintext — a serious security flaw.

### 6. Vulnerability: SQL Injection

* Insert an SQL injection payload in the GET request's token field:

```
2121747'+OR+'1'='1
```

* This can potentially bypass authentication or extract sensitive data.
