# MobSF with Static & Dynamic Analysis

For dynamic analysis Genymotion must be active.

Run MobSF with Genymotion integration:

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 1337:1337 -e MOBSF_ANALYZER_IDENTIFIER=<IP:PORT> opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
```

**Example:**

```
docker run -it --rm -p 8000:8000 -p 1337:1337 -e MOBSF_ANALYZER_IDENTIFIER=192.168.56.101:5555 opensecurity/mobile-security-framework-mobsf:latest
