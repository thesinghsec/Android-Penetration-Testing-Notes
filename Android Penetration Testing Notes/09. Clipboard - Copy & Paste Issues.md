### 1. Clipboard Data Leakage Overview

If an application allows copying sensitive data from any of its fields, there’s a risk that other applications running on the same device can access that data from the clipboard.
This can lead to unintended exposure of sensitive information.

### 2. Practical

* Enter a random number in one of the application's sensitive fields and copy it to the clipboard.

```
[ Sensitive Data Copied ]
```

### 3. Verify Clipboard Access

* Minimize the **SecureStore** application.
* Open another app.
* Create a new message and paste the copied data.

 The pasted data is the same — showing that another app was able to read it.

### 4. Security Risk

This demonstrates a security risk where sensitive data from one app is accessible by other apps on the device via the clipboard.
