```

Example:

```
d2j-dex2jar 01.\ TrainingApp.apk -o 1_training.jar
```


# 3. JADX-GUI

Used to read the decompiled jar file in a human-readable format. The code found is very similar to the original source code but not identical.

Run jadx-gui using:

```
jadx-gui <app.apk> &
`
jadx-gui 1_training.jar &
```

2. Open the application and map it with the code. For example, check the launcher activity in the code when you open the app.
3. Use the search function in jadx-gui to find any hardcoded values (e.g., secrets) in the code.
